This module allows to define and manage safe box groups.
A safe box group is a set of accounts of different companies that allows to manage an integrated cash management.
This is useful for multicompany environments with an integrated management of cash.
Cash can be moved between safe boxes inside the group without creation of account moves.
Also, the cash of each safe box is shared between all the companies, but, we are unable to know which part belongs to each one.
However, the total amount of all safe boxes must be equal to the balance of all the accounts.

This module allows to manage a safe box group, including:
